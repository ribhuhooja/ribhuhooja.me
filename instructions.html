    <h1>Save the world from global warming!</h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            Global temperatures have reached unprecedented levels. Luckily, we have the power of the seasons to try and
            stop the world from turning into a desert.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Your goal is to hold off against the encroaching deserts as long as possible. To your aid are three special artifacts:
            The bonfire, the snow sculpture, and the concert. As long as the tile they are on is not barren, you can take a special
            action in the Fall, Winter and Spring respectively, and try to undo the effects of global warming in the summer.

            In the fall, trees drop acorns that can grow into new trees if rained upon. You can take a special action if the 
            bonfire is still active, and either plant an additional acorn or extinguish a wildfire in a tile adjacent to a title
            with four trees. Beware, though, as wildfires will spread after your action.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the winter, wildfires are extinguished and any tile with three adjacent permafrost tiles also freezes. As long as
            the snow sculpture is active, you can freeze a tile, turning it into permafrost. This protects the tile from global warming,
            but also prevents acorns being planted or growing on the tile.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the Spring, storms move around and rain on tiles, turning acorns into trees. As long as the concert is active, you can
            choose a tile with at least one tree to produce a new storm on.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Beware the summer! The summer begins with global warming, which sets three random tiles, adjacent to a tile without trees,
            on fire (unless that tile has permafrost, in which case it melts instead). A third of all storms die out in this period.
            <br>
            After this, wildfires spread! Each time wildfires spread, a random tile adjacent to each tile with wildfire catches fire.
            Fire slowly burns down trees on the tile and destroys all acorns on the tile.
        </p>

        <p>
            If all the tiles turn barren, you lose! It is estimated that without your help, the earth will turn barren in just
            fifteen years. Can you protect it for longer than that?
